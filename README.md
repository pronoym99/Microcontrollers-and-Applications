# Microcontrollers-and-Applications
This repository contains all relevant 8051 based assembly level programs executed in Keil u Vision 5.

Important Notes:
----------------
* This repository as of now contains only assembly level programs before timers and counters and serial communication based programs.
* I plan to upload the remaining as soon as possible.
* After the first unit test I shall upload the solution to all labwork.
